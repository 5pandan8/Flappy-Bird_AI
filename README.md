# 🐦 Flappy Bird AI

A simple **Flappy Bird clone** built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and enhanced with an **AI agent trained using [NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** to play the game automatically.

The project demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to train agents in reinforcement-learning-like environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Classic Flappy Bird gameplay implemented with **Pygame**.
* AI agent learns to play the game using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm.
* Visualization of AI training and evolution across generations.
* Easy-to-understand code structure for learning purposes.

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the game

```bash
python flappyBird.py
```

---

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

This project is great for:

* Understanding how **neuroevolution** works.
* Learning **Pygame basics** for game development.
* Exploring the integration of AI with games.
